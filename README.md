# Philip Fulgham's Personal Website

This repo contains the source code for my personal website at http://philipfulgham.name.  The site is built in Angular, so "view source" isn't really sufficient to see what the website is doing.

## Legal

My website is not an open source project. I have made the source code available so that interested people can see how I make it work. In general, here are some of the things you MAY do:

- Adapt a piece of code that performs a certain function to accomplish a similar function in your own project.
- Use a substantial portion of the source code for an educational, non-commercial purpose, as long as proper attribution is given.
- Use a substantial portion of the source code to create a website with a substantially different design.

But here are some of the things you MAY NOT do, which override the above whenever they are in conflict:

- Create a publicly accessible duplicate of my website.
- Use my website as a template for any other website by substantially copying my design.
- Use a substantial portion of the source code for any project associated with a political cause or social movement.
- Use any part of the source code or design in any way that a third-party could reasonably see as implying my support for, endorsement of, or affiliation with your project, yourself, or anyone/anything you are affiliated with.
