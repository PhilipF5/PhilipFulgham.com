			Hey there, Internet, I’m Philip. I’m a software and web developer, which I’ve been doing for about nine years, mostly as a hobbyist, sometimes as a paid consultant or nonprofit volunteer. I’m particularly fond of .NET code, especially if it’s in C# (though I can handle VB just fine too), but as a user my heart lies with Apple. You can probably guess how delirious I am about the potential of .NET Core. I have plenty of dreams, but the most immediate one is to do this stuff full-time for a living, just as soon as I get my degree from Virginia Tech—just a few months left now!<br><br>I like to spend my time watching college sports, catching up on my <a (mouseenter)="show('shows')" (mouseleave)="hide('shows')">favorite TV shows<div id="shows"><ul><li *ngFor="let item of favoriteShows">{{item}}</li><li>•••</li></ul></div></a>, engrossing myself in one of my <a>favorite video games<div id="games" (mouseenter)="show('games')" (mouseleave)="hide('games')"><ul><li *ngFor="let item of favoriteGames">{{item}}</li><li>•••</li></ul></div></a>, or working on pet projects to sharpen my programming skills—for example, this website, built in Angular.
